Celery Root is intended as a replacement for the unmaintained Celery Flower. It supports a subset of Flower configuration and behavior, with more parity planned.

## Supported (today)

- `auth`, `basic_auth` for HTTP auth.
- `auth_provider` and OAuth fields.
- Prometheus metric naming compatibility.

## Partial support

- `address`, `port`: mapped to `FrontendConfig.host` and `FrontendConfig.port` (defaults differ).
- `enable_events`: events are enabled automatically and are not configurable.
- `persistent`, `db`: always stores state in SQLite, with a configurable path.

## Missing (planned)

- `flowerconfig.py` / `--conf` loader.
- `url_prefix` and `xheaders` support.
- TLS configuration in the dev server.
- Broker management API integration.
- Task list customization (`tasks_columns`, `format_task`, `natural_time`).
- State retention controls (`state_save_interval`, `max_workers`, `max_tasks`, `purge_offline_workers`).
- Metrics bucket customization.

If you rely on a missing feature, open an issue with your use case and target workflow.
