## Dashboard

The dashboard summarizes:

- Worker online count and load.
- Tasks processed today and throughput changes.
- Task runtime stats (avg, p95, p99).
- Recent activity feed.

## Tasks

`/tasks/` provides:

- Filtering by task name, worker, state, time range, and search.
- Sorting by state, worker, received time, started time, and runtime.
- Pagination controls.
- Detail view with args, kwargs, results, traceback, and stamps.
- Retry and revoke actions.
- Task graph visualization via `/tasks/<id>/graph/`.

You can also submit tasks from the UI (`/tasks/submit/`).

## Task graph

The task graph view (`/tasks/<id>/graph/`) visualizes task relations as the run unfolds.

Use the graph to:

- Inspect nodes to see task name, state, and runtime details.
- Switch layouts between chains, groups, chords, maps, and star-style overviews.
- Watch live updates as tasks complete and downstream nodes unlock.

## Workers

`/workers/` shows:

- Worker status (online, busy, offline).
- Pool size, active tasks, registered tasks, and queues.
- Broker grouping and per-worker drill-down.

Actions include:

- Grow/shrink the pool size.
- Autoscale.
- Restart workers.
- Add/remove consumers.

## Brokers

`/broker/` and `/brokers/<key>/` provide:

- Queue inventory and counts (best-effort).
- Pending task counts and consumer counts.
- Purge queues and purge idle queues.

## Beat schedules

`/beat/` lists schedules and allows:

- Add, edit, delete schedules.
- Sync schedules from the backend.
- Detects Celery Root's DB scheduler or `django-celery-beat`.

## Logs

`/logs/` reads log files from the configured log directory:

- Filter by component.
- Fetch a tail window of lines.
- JSON output with `?format=json`.

## Settings

`/settings/` shows component status and renders MCP client snippets (Codex and Claude). It also reports whether MCP auth is configured.
