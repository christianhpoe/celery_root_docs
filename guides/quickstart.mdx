## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- A running Celery broker
- One or more Celery workers (with events enabled)

## 1. Point Celery Root at your app

Set your worker import paths (comma-separated):

```bash
export CELERY_CNC_WORKERS="your_app.celery:app,another_app.celery:app"
```

You can also pass app import paths to the CLI with `-A`.

## 2. Start Celery Root

Standalone CLI:

```bash
celery-cnc -A your_app.celery:app
```

Or use the Celery subcommand:

```bash
celery -A your_app.celery:app cnc
```

By default the UI binds to `127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 3. Open the UI

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see workers, tasks, and queues.

## Common options

Override the UI host/port and debug mode:

```bash
celery-cnc -A your_app.celery:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --no-debug
```

Configure storage, logging, metrics, and MCP in the Configuration guide.
