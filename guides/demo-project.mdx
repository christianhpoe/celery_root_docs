## Overview

The demo project is a local, source-based stack with seeded test data. Use it when you want to explore Celery Root without wiring up your own workers. This runs from source instead of the prebuilt wheel.

## Install from source

From the repo root:

```bash
make install
```

This runs:

- `uv sync --all-extras --dev --frozen`
- `uv run pre-commit install`
- `npm --prefix frontend/graph-ui install`

## Start the demo workers

From the repo root:

```bash
cd demo
docker compose up --build
```

Once healthy, the seeder will dispatch demo tasks automatically.

## Seed demo tasks

Re-seed manually any time:

```bash
docker compose run --rm seeder
```

Seed demo tasks only (no server startup):

```bash
make demo_graph_tasks
```
